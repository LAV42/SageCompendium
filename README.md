# Symmetric Superpolynomials module for SAGE
Superpartitions, superpolynomial ring and superspace in SAGE.

This is intended to be used with the Compendium of results on superpolynomials which will be published on arXiv in early april.

This is a work in progress. Installation instructions will follow shortly. 

Users familiar with sage can clone the repository and start sage in Jupyter mode with

`sage -n jupyter`

Then opening SageCompendium.ipynb should get you started with functionalities of the module.
